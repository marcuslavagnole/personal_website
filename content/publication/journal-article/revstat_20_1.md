abstract: This paper provides a flexible methodology for the class of finite mixture of regressions with scale mixture of skew-normal errors (SMSN-FMRM), relaxing the constraints imposed by Zeller, C.B. and Cabral, C.R.B. and Lachos, V.H.(2016) during the estimation process. Based on the data augmentation principle and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, a Bayesian inference procedure is developed. A simulation study is implemented in order to understand the possible effects caused by the restrictions and an example with a well known dataset illustrates the performance of the proposed methods.
