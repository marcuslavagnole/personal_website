abstract: Crime prediction based on reliable data and sound statistical methodologies can provide a valuable input for tactical deployment of police resources in so-called crime hot spots and effective planning of police operations. In Rio de Janeiro, the forecasts of criminal activity are used by Public Safety Secretariat to detect crime patterns and to evaluate police performance. This paper evaluates the impact of reconciliation on the forecasts of 271 series of registered criminal occurrences in the city of Rio de Janeiro on a monthly basis from January 2003 to December 2019, and verifies that reconciliation improves crime count forecasts specially on the most disaggregated series.
