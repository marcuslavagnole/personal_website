#abstract: This paper proposes an extension of the Bayesian instrumental variables regression which allows spatial and temporal correlation among observations. For that, we introduce a double separable covariance matrix, adopting a Conditional Autoregressive structure for the spatial component, and a first-order autoregressive process for the temporal component. We also introduce a Bayesian multiple imputation to handle missing data considering uncertainty. The inference procedure is described joint with a step by step Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm for parameters estimation. We illustrate our methodology through a simulation study and a real application that investigates how broadband affects the Gross Domestic Product of municipalities in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul from 2010 to 2017.
